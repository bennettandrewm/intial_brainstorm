Welcome to the README, motherfucker!

"Yes they deserve to die and I hope they burn in hell" - Sam Jackson, A Time To Kill

That has nothing to do with this brainstorming, but I needed something to initialize this README, and the word motherfucker came out. Has Sam Jackson infiltrated my brain that much? Why can't I just edit out the word motherfucker prior to posting this on a public website? Some things are too challenging to figure out.
